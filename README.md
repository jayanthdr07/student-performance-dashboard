.# Student Performance Dashboard

A full-stack Student Performance Dashboard built with Java ,Spring Boot, MySQL, and Vanilla JS/HTML. Tracks student marks, attendance, grades, and fail reasons. Provides REST APIs for CRUD operations and displays analytics

## Project Overview

The **Student Performance Dashboard** is a full-stack application built using **Java Spring Boot, MySQL, and Vanilla JavaScript/HTML**. It allows teachers and administrators to track student marks, attendance, grades, and generate detailed reports including fail reasons.

This project demonstrates skills in **backend development, database management, REST API design, and full-stack integration** — perfect for a **Java Backend Developer portfolio**.

## Objectives

- Build a cloud-ready full-stack application with minimal folder structure.  
- Track student marks, attendance, grades, remarks, and fail reasons.  
- Enable CRUD operations on student data via REST APIs.  
- Provide a simple dashboard interface for data visualization.  
- Demonstrate SQL, Spring Boot, and frontend integration skills.
